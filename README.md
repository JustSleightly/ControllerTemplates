All sample logic below is designed to work regardless of your Write Defaults settings unless otherwise specified, and thus should be ignored in any downloaded samples. Please exercise due diligence to use whichever one is compatible with your Avatar, as well as mask any layers as needed.

All sample logic is designed so that bools use `True` for `On` and `False` for `Off`. Arrow indicators in your Expressions Menu represent True.

---

`Buffer`: *An animation clip with an invalid property that is typically 1 frame long*

`Toggle`: *Selecting between 2 options*

`Multi-Toggle`: *Selecting between 3 or more options*

`Independent`: *Each toggle maintains its selection despite the state of other toggles*

`Exclusive`: *Only one option can be active per exclusive group*

`Disable`: *Adds an additional option to a multi-toggle where all other options are disabled*

`Custom`: *Niche logic that was probably requested by someone*
