All sample logic below is designed to work regardless of your Write Defaults settings unless otherwise specified, and thus should be ignored in any downloaded samples. Please exercise due diligence to use whichever one is compatible with your Avatar, as well as mask any layers as needed.

All sample logic is designed so that bools use True for On and False for Off. Arrow indicators in your Expressions Menu represent True.

Buffer: An animation clip with an invalid property that is typically 1 frame long

Toggle: Selecting between 2 options

Multi-Toggle: Selecting between 3 or more options

Independent: Each toggle maintains its selection despite the state of other toggles

Exclusive: Only one option can be active per exclusive group

Disable: Adds an additional option to a multi-toggle where all other options are disabled

Custom: Niche logic that was probably requested by someone
